<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I used a simple method to rate nootropics. First, I set three metrics: <strong>memory</strong>, <strong>focus</strong>, and <strong>mental energy</strong>. I scored each from 1 to 5. Then I ran three tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Memory quiz:</strong> I used free online recall tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Work session:</strong> I timed how long I stayed sharp on writing tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Study session:</strong> I read complex articles and noted clarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested three dosages: 800 mg, 1 200 mg, and 1 600 mg, all taken morning on an empty stomach. I tracked scores daily. After two weeks, Oxiracetam earned an average of 4.6/5 overall. I ranked it #2 in my personal nootropic stack.</p>

<h2>Personal Experience</h2>
<p>Day 1: At 800 mg, I felt a light lift in focus. Words in my head felt crisper.<br>
Day 5: At 1 200 mg, I noticed faster recall on memory quizzes. I mistyped 30% fewer words.<br>
Day 10: At 1 600 mg, I felt alert without jitters. Study sessions of two hours felt smooth.</p>
<p>I noted no crash in the afternoon. Hydration and a choline source kept me free of headaches. My mind felt agile. Tasks that bored me before now held my interest for longer. By week two, my test scores on memory drills rose from 60% to 80%.</p>
